A query language for interacting with a GraphQL endpoint to retrieve, update, and subscribe to notifications.
Tooling and SDKs for building GraphQL clients and servers, or interacting with GraphQL endpoints such as the GraphiQL editor, clients like Apollo and Relay, servers like Apollo, GraphQL for .NET, and more.
